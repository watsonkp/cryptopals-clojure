# Cryptopals solutions in Clojure

Test cases complete [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com) challenges.

This is a foolish attempt to learn Clojure, functional programming, and cryptography at the same time. It's a fun challenge, but certainly doesn't result in nice code or the quick completion of challenges.

Not all challenges have been completed. Currently working on challenge 20.
